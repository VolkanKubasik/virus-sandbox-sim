# Virus Sandbox & Evolution Simulation

This project simulates the evolution and behavior of virus-like programs **only inside an isolated test directory**.  
It models branching, mutation, message passing, and basic "malware" actions, but never interacts with system or user files outside of its sandbox.

## Features
- Branching and evolving simulated virus processes in a controlled directory.
- Mutations, encrypting/decrypting, and other "skills" applied only to files within the project folder.
- Statistical self-analysis and internal English phrase learning.
- No networking, no real infection, no destructive actions outside its own sandbox.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

- **This code is NOT real malware and does not damage or affect any files or systems outside the test sandbox.**
- **For research, demonstration, and educational purposes only.**
- Do not use or adapt this software for any kind of malicious or unlawful usage.

## Security & Ethics Disclaimer

>This program never touches or modifies system/user data, and is strictly designed as a safe toy/teaching tool.  
>You must NOT use this code, or derivatives of it, for harm, intrusion, exfiltration, or to evade security controls in any real environment.
